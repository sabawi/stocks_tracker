Terminal Based Stock Market Tracker
===================================

Purpose: This script tracks stock prices, calculates changes, and displays the information in a terminal interface using the curses library.

It fetches stock data using the yfinance library, calculates price changes, and displays the results in a table format. 
The table updates every `interval` seconds and can be exited by pressing 'q'.
